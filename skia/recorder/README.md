QUESTIONS: 

- how to deal with errors ( im raising exceptions so something falls through to the end... )
    feels like cpp likes returning ints :D 
- how to run a debugger, segfaults are a pain
- what to do with this guy
    ```// hmm "no default constructor exists bla bla... "
	rive::SkiaRenderer renderer(rasterCanvas);```
  not looked much yet. but i was hoping to declae that i got em.. but then i 'd get thi default constructor errr... 
- headers and stuff.. all imports into the headers? 
    good way to strip unused imports?
